# SQL-DDL-DESIGN
In this practice I created some basic DDL design schemas for 3 different types of groups including a soccer leauge, a medical center, and a craigslist mockup.
Also in 3 different files I got to practice the concept of "normilization". I took 3 different schemas including an airlines, music production, and orbital information and refactored the schema to best fit for normalization.
In the normalization practice the first couple tables are the refactored code and the one big table below them is the original un-refactored schema.
